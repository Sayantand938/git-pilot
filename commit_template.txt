Standard Git commit message format:
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
scope: optional area of the codebase (like api, ui, etc.)
short summary: 50 characters or less

Optional body: explain what was changed and why (wrap at 72 characters)
Optional footer: reference issues, breaking changes, etc.

Example:
