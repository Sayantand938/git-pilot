'feat(multi-book): implement multi-book support\n\nThis commit introduces a foundational multi-book architecture to the application.\n\n- Introduced `src/data/books.json` to store metadata for multiple books and their chapters.\n- Migrated existing chapter data from `chapter-map.json` (which was deleted) to `books.json`.\n- Restructured data files, moving chapter and exercise JSONs into book-specific directories (e.g., `src/data/ganitprabha/`).\n- Refactored `src/lib/data-service.ts` to handle book-specific data fetching and dynamic imports.\n- Updated application routing to incorporate `bookId` as a parameter for navigation.\n- Created `ChapterListPage.tsx` to display chapters for a selected book.\n- Transformed `HomePage.tsx` to list available books instead of individual chapters.\n- Adapted `ChapterIndexPage.tsx` and `ExercisePage.tsx` to work with the new `bookId` parameter and data structure.'

'refactor(data): implement dynamic book index generation\n\nOverhaul how book and exercise data is structured, indexed, and fetched.\n\n- Move all book, chapter, and exercise JSON data from `src/data` to `public/books`.\n- Introduce `scripts/generate-book-index.cjs` to dynamically create/update `public/books/books.json` at build time.\n- The index script scans chapter directories to populate available exercises for each chapter.\n- Integrate `generate-book-index` into `dev` and `build` scripts for automated data indexing.\n- Update `data-service.ts` to asynchronously `fetch` book and exercise metadata from `public/books/books.json`.\n- Exercise content JSON files are now fetched directly from the `public` directory at runtime.\n- Remove the static `src/data/books.json` and the dynamic `import.meta.glob` for exercises.\n- Adjust page components to use the new asynchronous data fetching methods.'

"refactor(timer): redesign timer as a stopwatch\n\nThis commit significantly refactors the timer functionality, transitioning\nit from a fixed-duration countdown (Pomodoro-style) to a flexible\nstopwatch.\n\nKey changes include:\n- Timer now counts up (timeElapsed) instead of down (timeLeft).\n- Removed the fixed 'focus duration' setting from the Settings feature\n  and its associated UI component.\n- Added a 'Finish & Log' button to explicitly record the duration of a\n  focus session once completed, with a minimum 1-minute requirement.\n- Updated `focus-sheet.store`'s `addSession` to support an optional\n  `showToast` parameter, allowing for custom notification handling.\n- Redesigned timer UI with icon-only controls, dynamic button states,\n  tooltips, and a simpler HH:MM:SS display format.\n- Updated various application icons for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows\n  to ensure consistent branding and support new resolutions.\n- Removed desktop notifications for session completion in favor of in-app\n  toasts for session logging."
